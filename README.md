# Chat

### Requirements
* [MY esx_identity](https://github.com/ArkSeyonet/esx_identity)
* [MY esx_voice](https://github.com/ArkSeyonet/esx_voice)
* [MY esx_skin](https://github.com/ArkSeyonet/esx_skin)

## Download & Installation

### Using Git
```
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/ArkSeyonet/chat.git [system]/chat
```


### Manually
- Download https://github.com/ArkSeyonet/chat/archive/master.zip
- Put it in the `[system]` directory


### NOTE
- This is only meant to work alongside the ESX Identity Redux on my Github. There is no other reason to use this script, as it will overwrite the default chat script for FiveM.
